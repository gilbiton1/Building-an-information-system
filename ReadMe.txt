The purpose of the project was to answer business needs through an information system. We chose a real company that is engaged in construction, we talked to different people in the organization and deeply understood the business needs. After that, we developed an information system that would provide an answer to these needs and significantly upgrade the company's conduct, examples of the system's uses - inventory management and finding products in the system using Makt, an interface for the client to schedule a meeting, enter possible meeting times, project monitoring, employee management, and more.
